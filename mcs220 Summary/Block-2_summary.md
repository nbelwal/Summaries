### Unit 7: Spring MVC Concepts

**Main Idea:** This unit focuses specifically on Spring MVC, providing a detailed explanation of its core concepts and practical steps for developing web applications, from environment setup to form validation.

**Key Points:**

*   **Spring MVC Introduction:** An open-source Java framework following the MVC design pattern, leveraging Spring's core features like IoC and DI for lightweight and modular web application development.
*   **Development Environment Setup:** Emphasizes using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Eclipse or NetBeans and setting up Spring Framework libraries.
*   **First Hello World Project:** Provides a step-by-step guide to create a simple Spring MVC web application, including:
    *   Project creation (Dynamic Web Project).
    *   Adding Spring and other necessary libraries.
    *   Creating Controller, configuration files (`web.xml`, `HelloWeb-servlet.xml`), and view files (JSP).
    *   Deployment as a WAR file or direct execution on a server.
*   **Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection (DI):**
    *   **IoC:** A design principle (or pattern) that inverts control over object creation and binding, leading to loose coupling. Spring IoC container (BeanFactory, ApplicationContext) manages object instantiation and dependencies.
    *   **DI:** A design pattern implementing IoC, where dependencies are provided externally (e.g., via XML configuration or annotations) rather than being hardcoded within a class. Achieved via Constructor Injection or Setter Injection, making code loosely coupled and testable.
*   **Creating Controllers and Views:**
    *   **Controllers:** Java classes that handle client requests, invoke business logic, and redirect to logical view names. Responsibilities include intercepting requests, mapping payload to data structures, sending data to Model, and referring processed data to View. `@Controller` and `@RequestMapping` annotations are key.
    *   **Views:** Presentation layer components (e.g., JSP). `DispatcherServlet` acts as the "Front Controller" in Spring MVC, dispatching requests to controllers and resolving views.
    *   **Configuration:** `web.xml` configures `DispatcherServlet`. Spring bean configuration file (`ignou-serv-servlet.xml`) defines component scanning and `InternalResourceViewResolver` for view resolution.
*   **Request Params and Request Mapping:**
    *   **`@RequestParam`:** Used in controller methods to bind web request parameters to method parameters, simplifying data retrieval from HTTP requests.
    *   **`@RequestMapping`:** A flexible annotation for mapping requests to controller methods based on path, HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), query parameters, or request headers.
*   **Form Tags and Data Binding:**
    *   **Spring MVC Form Tags:** Configurable and reusable building blocks (e.g., `<form:form>`, `<form:input>`, `<form:radiobutton>`, `<form:checkbox>`, `<form:select>`, `<form:textarea>`). They simplify form development and enable data binding.
    *   **Data Binding:** Mechanism to dynamically bind user inputs from web requests to Java objects (Beans/POJOs). `DataBinder` and `WebDataBinder` classes facilitate this, often in conjunction with `PropertyEditors` for parsing and formatting.
*   **Form Validation:**
    *   Crucial for validating user input on the server-side.
    *   Spring Framework (v4+) supports Bean Validation (JSR-303/349).
    *   `BindingResult` interface represents binding results and registers errors.
    *   Common Validation Annotations (from `javax.validation.constraints`): `@Valid`, `@Size`, `@Pattern`, `@Past`, `@Null`, `@NotNull`, `@Min`, `@Max`, `@Future`, `@Digits`, `@DecimalMin`, `@DecimalMax`, `@AssertTrue`, `@AssertFalse`.

**Conclusion:** Unit 7 provides a practical deep dive into Spring MVC, demonstrating how its core principles (IoC/DI), annotations, and helper classes facilitate the structured development of web applications with robust request handling, data binding, and validation capabilities.

### Unit 8: Spring MVC with Bootstrap CSS

**Main Idea:** This unit focuses on integrating Spring MVC with front-end (Bootstrap, custom CSS) and back-end (Hibernate for database operations) technologies to build a complete, responsive, and data-driven web application.

**Key Points:**

*   **Responsive Web Design (RWD):** Highlights the importance of RWD for adapting websites to various screen sizes and devices, improving user experience and business reach.
*   **Bootstrap:**
    *   A free, popular, open-source CSS framework for responsive, mobile-first front-end web development.
    *   Provides HTML and CSS-based design templates for UI components and optional JavaScript extensions.
    *   **Advantages:** Browser support, responsive design, uniform interface solution, easy customization, functional built-in components.
    *   **Configuration in Spring MVC:**
        *   **Content Delivery Network (CDN):** Efficient, faster, and proximity-based content delivery.
        *   **Local Download:** Downloading Bootstrap CSS/JS files and including them locally. Requires resource mapping in Spring (XML or Java configuration) and inclusion via JSTL `c:url` or Spring `spring:url` tags in JSPs.
*   **Apply Custom CSS in Pages:**
    *   CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to add stylistic instructions to websites, separating style from HTML structure.
    *   Custom CSS files (e.g., `custom.css`) can be created and linked in the `<head>` section of JSP pages to maintain uniform styling across an application.
    *   Key components: Selectors (HTML elements to style), Properties (attributes to change), Values (desired attribute changes).
*   **Setting Up Database using Hibernate:**
    *   Spring facilitates easy integration with Hibernate for database setup and interaction.
    *   **Key Spring Beans for Hibernate Integration (`org.springframework.orm.hibernate5`):**
        *   `LocalSessionFactoryBean`: Creates Hibernate's SessionFactory.
        *   `PlatformTransactionManager`: Provides transaction support, enabling `@Transactional` annotation for DAO methods.
    *   Requires specific Maven dependencies (spring-orm, hibernate-core, database connector like MySQL).
    *   Java-based configuration (e.g., `HibernateConfig` class) defines `DataSource` (database connection), `LocalSessionFactoryBean` (Hibernate session factory), and `PlatformTransactionManager` (transaction management), typically using properties from an `application.properties` file.
*   **Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) Operations:**
    *   A fundamental paradigm in computer programming for interacting with data sources.
    *   **Mapping CRUD to SQL Statements:**
        *   **C**reate: `INSERT`
        *   **R**ead: `SELECT`
        *   **U**pdate: `UPDATE`
        *   **D**elete: `DELETE`
    *   **Mapping CRUD to REST (HTTP Verbs):**
        *   **C**reate: `POST` (e.g., `POST /students/`)
        *   **R**ead: `GET` (e.g., `GET /students/` or `GET /students/{id}`) - Idempotent.
        *   **U**pdate: `PUT` or `PATCH` (e.g., `PUT /students/{id}`) - Idempotent.
        *   **D**elete: `DELETE` (e.g., `DELETE /students/{id}`) - Idempotent.
*   **CRUD Examples in Spring MVC and Hibernate:**
    *   Provides a comprehensive code example of a "Student Management System (SMS)" application.
    *   Demonstrates the integration of:
        *   Bootstrap configuration (using CDN).
        *   Custom CSS.
        *   Spring and Hibernate integration for database operations.
        *   Implementation of all CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) at the database level using MySQL.
    *   Includes configuration classes (`WebMvcConfig`, `HibernateConfig`, `AppInitializer`), Controller (`AppController`), Service Layer (`StudentService`, `StudentServiceImpl`), Model (`Student`), DAO Layer (`StudentDao`, `StudentDaoImpl`), Hibernate properties, and JSP views for forms and data display.

**Conclusion:** Unit 8 culminates the learning by demonstrating how to build a full-stack J2EE web application. It showcases the practical integration of Spring MVC for web logic, Hibernate for robust data persistence, and front-end technologies like Bootstrap and custom CSS for a responsive and user-friendly interface, effectively implementing the core CRUD functionalities.
