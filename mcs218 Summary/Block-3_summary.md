### **Unit 1: Introduction to Layer Functionality and Design Issues**

**Main Idea:** The Network Layer (OSI Layer 3) is responsible for end-to-end packet delivery from a source to a destination, managing various services and design considerations.

**Key Points:**
*   **Network Layer Services:**
    *   **Routing:** Decides the optimal path for a packet based on metrics (e.g., delay, hop count).
    *   **Packetization:** Divides data segments from the Transport Layer into smaller packets, adding control headers.
    *   **Forwarding:** At each router, decides the specific output interface for a packet to proceed on its chosen route.
*   **Packet Switching:** The Internet primarily uses packet switching, where resources are shared on demand.
    *   **Virtual Circuit (Connection-oriented Service):**
        *   Establishes a logical end-to-end connection before data transfer (setup, data transfer, termination phases).
        *   Ensures reliable, in-order delivery with acknowledgements and retransmission policies.
        *   Routers involved in setup, maintain connection state (Virtual Circuit Identifier - VC-ID) in forwarding tables.
        *   Forwarding decisions are based on the VC-ID, not the full destination address.
        *   Congestion avoidance is easier due to resource reservation.
    *   **Datagram (Connection-less Service):**
        *   No connection setup or handshaking; packets are sent immediately.
        *   Each packet (datagram) is treated independently, potentially taking different paths, leading to out-of-order delivery or loss.
        *   Unreliable service (e.g., UDP, IP) but offers less overhead and is suitable for delay-sensitive or loss-tolerant applications.
        *   Forwarding decisions are based on the destination address (often using longest prefix matching).
*   **Network Addressing:**
    *   **IP Address:** A unique, 32-bit logical address (IPv4) for each network interface, commonly written in dotted decimal notation.
    *   **Hierarchy:** IP addresses are divided into a network portion and a host portion, supporting hierarchical routing.
    *   **Assignment:** Can be assigned manually (static) or dynamically (e.g., by DHCP).
*   **Congestion:** Occurs when the packet arrival rate exceeds the network's handling capacity, leading to queuing delay, packet drops, and retransmissions.
    *   **Control Mechanisms:**
        *   **Open Loop (Prevention):** Admission policy, retransmission policy, acknowledgement policy, discard policy.
        *   **Closed Loop (Removal):** Choke packets, explicit signaling, implicit signaling.
*   **Routing:** The process of determining the best path for packets.
    *   **Properties:** Aims for the best route (based on metrics), adapts to congestion, requires node cooperation, and ensures quick convergence and stability.
    *   **Classification:**
        *   **Global (Centralized):** Computes routes with complete network knowledge (e.g., Link State algorithms like Dijkstra's).
        *   **Decentralized:** Iterative and distributed, where nodes exchange information with neighbors (e.g., Distance Vector algorithms).
        *   **Adaptive (Dynamic):** Updates routes based on topology or traffic changes.
        *   **Non-adaptive (Static):** Manually configured routes that do not automatically respond to network changes.
*   **Delay in Packet Switched Networks:**
    *   **Types:** Transmission delay (L/R), propagation delay (distance/speed), processing delay (router processing), queuing delay (waiting in buffer).
    *   **Total Delay:** Summation of all delays across all links and routers in the path.

### **Unit 2: Routing Algorithms**

**Main Idea:** This unit delves into specific algorithms and protocols used by the Network Layer to establish and maintain routing tables for efficient packet delivery.

**Key Points:**
*   **Flooding:** A broadcasting technique to disseminate topology changes to all nodes. Can be uncontrolled (duplicates) or controlled (sequence numbers, spanning trees).
*   **Shortest Path Routing:** A greedy approach to find the least-cost path.
    *   **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** A widely used algorithm that computes the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes by iteratively selecting the lowest-cost tentative node.
*   **Distance Vector Routing (Bellman-Ford Algorithm):**
    *   **Mechanism:** Distributed and iterative; each router maintains a "distance vector" (routing table) with costs to all destinations, updated by exchanging information with direct neighbors using the Bellman-Ford equation.
    *   **Comparison with Link State:** Lower message complexity (neighbor-only exchange) but slower and less predictable convergence, susceptible to routing loops.
    *   **Count-to-Infinity Problem:** A serious drawback where a link failure can cause routing loops and costs to destinations to increment infinitely.
    *   **Solutions:** Route Poisoning (setting a max hop count, e.g., 16 for RIP) and Split Horizon (not sending route info back on the interface it was received from).
*   **Link State Routing:**
    *   **Mechanism:** Each router gains a complete view of the network topology by exchanging "link state packets" (LSPs) containing information about its directly connected links and their states with *all* other routers. Each router then independently runs Dijkstra's algorithm to compute its own routing table.
    *   **Protocols:** OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) and IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System) are common examples.
    *   **Drawbacks:** High CPU overhead for recalculation and significant memory requirement for storing the full topology map.
*   **Hierarchical Routing:**
    *   **Purpose:** To manage routing in very large networks by dividing them into regions/clusters. Routers only store detailed routing information for their own region and a single entry for other regions.
    *   **Benefit:** Reduces routing table size and traffic overhead from routing information exchange.
*   **Internet Protocol (IP):**
    *   **IPv4 Addressing:** 32-bit addresses, classified into A, B, C, D, E based on the first octet, with reserved ranges for private networks, loopback, and multicast.
    *   **IPv4 Datagram Format:** Contains a header (variable size due to 'options' field) and a data section. Key header fields include Version, IHL, DSCP, ECN, Total Length, Identification, Flags (DF, MF), Fragment Offset, TTL, Protocol, Header Checksum, Source/Destination Address.
    *   **IP Datagram Fragmentation:** Packets are fragmented by routers if they exceed the MTU (Maximum Transferable Unit) of an outgoing link and the 'Do not Fragment' flag is not set. Reassembly occurs only at the destination host.
    *   **IPv6:** A 128-bit address space designed to address IPv4 exhaustion, using hexadecimal notation. Features a fixed-size header and does not allow in-transit fragmentation by routers. Includes IPSec as an optional header.
    *   **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol):** A network layer protocol for error reporting and management queries (e.g., host unreachable, congestion control).
    *   **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):** Automates the assignment of IP addresses and other network configuration parameters to devices.
    *   **IPSec (IP Security):** Provides confidentiality, integrity, and authentication services for IP packets, enabling secure communication.
*   **Routing in the Internet:**
    *   **Intra-Autonomous System (Intra-AS) Routing:** Protocols operating within a single administrative domain (AS).
        *   **RIP (Routing Information Protocol):** A Distance Vector protocol suitable for small networks, with a maximum hop count of 15.
        *   **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First):** A Link State protocol for large networks, using bandwidth/congestion as metrics and having no hop count limit.
    *   **Inter-Autonomous System (Inter-AS) Routing:** Protocols for routing between different ASs.
        *   **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol):** The primary inter-AS routing protocol used on the Internet to exchange network reachability information among ISPs.
*   **Multicast Routing:** Efficiently sends the same information to a group of clients simultaneously by constructing and pruning logical spanning trees for each group. Challenges arise in managing group membership and storing multiple pruned trees.
*   **Mobile IP:** An extension of the standard IP protocol that enables mobile devices to maintain their IP address and active connections while moving between different networks.

### **Unit 3: Congestion Control Algorithms**

**Main Idea:** Congestion control aims to prevent or alleviate network performance degradation when traffic load exceeds network capacity, ensuring efficient resource utilization.

**Key Points:**
*   **Causes of Congestion:**
    *   Packet arrival rate exceeding output line capacity (buffer overflow, packet drops).
    *   Slow processing at intermediate devices (routers).
    *   Low link bandwidth.
    *   Bursty nature of traffic.
    *   Fundamental mismatch between network capacity and traffic load.
*   **Congestion Control vs. Flow Control:**
    *   **Congestion Control:** A network-wide issue concerned with the overall traffic load relative to network capacity.
    *   **Flow Control:** A point-to-point issue (e.g., between a sender and receiver) to prevent a fast sender from overwhelming a slow receiver.
*   **Congestion Prevention Mechanisms:**
    *   **Open Loop Control (Preventive, Static):** Policies implemented at the source or destination to prevent congestion before it occurs.
        *   **Retransmission Policy:** Optimizing timers to avoid unnecessary retransmissions that exacerbate congestion.
        *   **Window Policy:** Preferring Selective Repeat over Go-Back-N to reduce redundant retransmissions.
        *   **Discarding Policy:** Prioritizing packet drops (e.g., unreliable UDP packets before reliable TCP packets) during congestion.
        *   **Acknowledgement Policy:** Using cumulative acknowledgements to reduce control traffic.
        *   **Admission Control:** Only admitting new traffic or virtual circuit requests if the network can handle them without becoming congested.
        *   **Traffic Policing:** Monitors traffic flow and *discards* packets that exceed a predefined rate, without buffering.
        *   **Traffic Shaping:** Uses buffers to *delay* and smooth out bursty traffic, ensuring a more even transmission rate over time.
            *   **Leaky Bucket Shaper:** Enforces a fixed output rate, smoothing all traffic.
            *   **Token Bucket Shaper:** Allows bursts up to a certain limit (determined by available tokens) while maintaining an average rate.
*   **Congestion Control in Packet-Switched Networks:**
    *   **Transport Layer (TCP):** Adjusts transmission rates based on network feedback (e.g., window size adjustments).
    *   **Network Layer (Routers):** Employ queuing algorithms (e.g., FIFO, Fair Queuing, RED) to manage buffers and prioritize packets. May send explicit choke packets or use Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to signal congestion to senders.

    *   **Applications:** Agriculture (monitoring, livestock), military (surveillance, border protection), environment (pollution, flood/landslide warning, forest fire detection), health (patient monitoring, wearable devices), traffic management, and industrial/structural monitoring.
    *   **Structure:** Comprises sensor nodes (with sensing, processing, communication, and power units) that communicate with each other and often with a central Base Node/Station connected to the Internet.
    *   **Classification:** Can be categorized by size (PAN, LAN, MAN, WAN), mobility (stationary, mobile), base station count (single, multi-), hop count (single, multi-), organization (self-organized, non-self-organized), and node homogeneity (homogeneous, heterogeneous).
    *   **Topologies:** Common topologies include Star (simple, low sensor power, minimal delay, but base station is a single point of failure) and Mesh (more reliable, covers large areas, multi-hop, but higher power consumption).
*   **Internet of Things (IoT):**
    *   **Definition:** A network of physical objects ("Things") embedded with sensors, actuators, and software, enabling them to connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the Internet.
