**Unit 7: Data Mining – An Introduction**

*   **Definition and Purpose:**
    *   Data Mining (also known as Knowledge Discovery in Data - KDD) is the process of uncovering patterns and valuable information from large datasets.
    *   It provides two primary advantages: **predictive power** (estimating unknown/future values) and **descriptive power** (finding interesting patterns).
    *   It helps organizations make knowledge-driven decisions by analyzing vast amounts of data, converting raw data into meaningful information.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   Gathers reliable information.
    *   Cost-effective compared to other data applications.
    *   Aids in profitable production/operational adjustments.
    *   Helps detect credit risks and fraud.
    *   Facilitates quick analysis of enormous datasets and automated predictions.
*   **How Data Mining Works (CRISP-DM Model):** A flexible, six-phase life cycle:
    1.  **Business Understanding:** Defining objectives, problems, and required data.
    2.  **Data Understanding:** Collecting relevant data from various sources.
    3.  **Data Preparation:** The most time-consuming phase, involving ETL (Extraction, Transformation, Loading) – cleaning, handling nulls, removing duplicates, resolving errors, and formatting.
    4.  **Modeling:** Applying statistical and mathematical approaches (e.g., classification, clustering, regression).
    5.  **Evaluation:** Assessing model efficiency against business objectives (human-driven).
    6.  **Deployment:** Putting the validated model into use (e.g., reports, new strategies).
*   **Classification of Data Mining Systems:** Categorized by:
    *   Type of data source (e.g., spatial, multimedia, text, WWW).
    *   Data model (e.g., relational, data warehouse).
    *   Kind of knowledge discovered (e.g., characterization, association, classification, clustering).
    *   Mining techniques used (e.g., machine learning, neural networks, statistics).
*   **Common Data Mining Techniques:**
    *   **Classification Analysis:** Assigning data points to predefined groups based on a question.
    *   **Association Rule Learning:** Uncovering relationships between data points (e.g., items bought together).
    *   **Anomaly or Outlier Detection:** Finding data that doesn't conform to patterns (e.g., fraud detection).
    *   **Clustering Analysis:** Grouping data points with shared traits into subsets (without predefined groups).
    *   **Regression Analysis:** Understanding influential factors and predicting numeric values.
*   **Data Mining vs. Data Warehousing:**
    *   **Data Warehouse:** A system for collecting and managing data from varied sources, designed for query and analysis (a repository).
    *   **Data Mining:** The process of discovering hidden, valid, and potentially useful patterns within large datasets, often residing in a data warehouse. Data warehousing *precedes* data mining.
*   **Applications:** Retail (Market Basket Analysis), Financial (fraud, credit risk), Healthcare (diagnosis, fraud), Education (student behavior), CRM, Bioinformatics, Inventory Planning, Intrusion Detection, Criminal Investigation, Operational Optimization.
*   **Issues in Data Mining:**
    *   **Mining Methodology & User Interaction:** Handling diverse knowledge types, interactive mining, incorporating background knowledge, query languages, result visualization, noisy/incomplete data, pattern evaluation.
    *   **Performance Issues:** Efficiency and scalability of algorithms, need for parallel, distributed, and incremental mining.
    *   **Diverse Data Types Issues:** Handling complex data objects (multimedia, spatial, temporal), mining heterogeneous databases.

**Unit 8: Data Preprocessing**

*   **Overview and Purpose:**
    *   A fundamental and crucial step in data mining that transforms raw, often inconsistent, incomplete, or noisy data into an understandable and usable format.
    *   Ensures data quality (accuracy, completeness, consistency, validity, timeliness) for effective data analysis and improved machine learning model performance.
*   **Stages of Data Preprocessing:**
    1.  **Data Cleaning:**
        *   **Missing Values:** Techniques include ignoring tuples, manual filling, using global constants, attribute means, or most likely values (e.g., regression, decision trees).
        *   **Noisy Data:** Handling random variance, incorrect values, duplicates. Methods include:
            *   **Binning:** Smoothing values by partitioning into "bins" (e.g., by mean or boundaries).
            *   **Regression:** Smoothing data by fitting it to a function.
            *   **Clustering:** Detecting outliers as values outside defined clusters.
    2.  **Data Integration:**
        *   Merging data from heterogeneous sources into a consistent dataset.
        *   **Approaches:** Data consolidation (physical storage in one place), data virtualization (unified real-time view), data propagation (copying data).
        *   **Issues:** Schema integration (different naming for same entities), redundancy (derived attributes), and data value conflicts (different representations/units for same attribute).
    3.  **Data Transformation:**
        *   Converting data into appropriate formats for efficient computer learning.
        *   **Strategies:**
            *   **Smoothing:** Removing noise to highlight main features.
            *   **Aggregation:** Summarizing or grouping data.
            *   **Discretization:** Converting continuous data into discrete intervals.
            *   **Attribute Construction:** Creating new attributes to simplify original data.
            *   **Generalization:** Converting low-level attributes to higher-level concepts (e.g., numeric age to "young/old").
            *   **Normalization:** Scaling variables to a given range (e.g., Min-Max, Z-Score, Decimal Scaling).
    4.  **Data Reduction:**
        *   Reducing the amount of data while maintaining its integrity, crucial for large datasets.
        *   **Strategies:**
            *   **Data Cube Aggregation:** Using pre-computed summary data in data cubes.
            *   **Attribute Subset Selection:** Removing redundant or irrelevant attributes (e.g., stepwise selection, decision tree induction).
            *   **Dimensionality Reduction:** Reducing the number of random variables (e.g., PCA, correlation filters, random forest).
            *   **Numerosity Reduction:** Replacing original information with smaller representations (e.g., parametric methods like regression, non-parametric methods like histograms, clustering, sampling).
            *   **Data Discretization and Concept Hierarchy Generation:** Reducing continuous attribute values into intervals or higher logical levels, often automatically based on data distribution.

**Unit 9: Mining Frequent Patterns and Associations**

*   **Frequent Patterns:** Patterns (itemsets, subsequences, substructures) that appear frequently in a dataset.
*   **Market Basket Analysis:** A typical application of frequent itemset mining, analyzing customer buying habits to find associations between items purchased together (e.g., milk and bread). This helps retailers with marketing and store layout.
*   **Classification of Frequent Pattern Mining:** Based on completeness, levels of abstraction, number of data dimensions, types of values, and kinds of rules/patterns to be mined.
*   **Association Rule Mining (ARM):**
    *   A popular descriptive data mining technique for discovering relationships among items.
    *   A rule is in the form `X => Y`, where X (antecedent) and Y (consequent) are disjoint itemsets.
    *   **Two Phases:**
        1.  **Find Frequent Itemsets:** Identify itemsets that meet a user-defined `minimum support` threshold (frequency of occurrence).
        2.  **Generate Association Rules:** Create rules from frequent itemsets that meet a `minimum confidence` threshold (strength/reliability of the implication).
    *   **Key Concepts:**
        *   **Itemset:** A set of items (e.g., {milk, bread}).
        *   **k-Itemset:** An itemset containing k items.
        *   **Frequent Itemset:** An itemset meeting the minimum support count.
        *   **Support (A => B):** `P(A U B)` - the percentage of transactions containing both A and B.
        *   **Confidence (A => B):** `P(B | A) = support(A U B) / support(A)` - the percentage of transactions containing A that also contain B.
        *   **Lift (A => B):** `support(A U B) / (support(A) * support(B))` - measures the correlation between A and B.
            *   `Lift > 1`: Positive correlation (occurrence of one implies the other).
            *   `Lift < 1`: Negative correlation.
            *   `Lift = 1`: Independent.
        *   **Conviction:** Another measure of rule interest.
    *   **Applications:** Market basket analysis, CRM, medical diagnosis, census data, protein sequencing.
*   **The Apriori Algorithm:**
    *   A seminal algorithm for mining frequent itemsets for Boolean association rules.
    *   Employs an iterative, **level-wise search** approach (uses frequent k-itemsets to find (k+1)-itemsets).
    *   Uses the **Apriori property**: "All nonempty subsets of a frequent itemset must also be frequent."
    *   Follows a **join and prune** strategy:
        1.  **Join Step:** Generate candidate k-itemsets (Ck) from frequent (k-1)-itemsets (Lk-1).
        2.  **Prune Step:** Eliminate candidates from Ck if any of their (k-1)-subsets are not in Lk-1.
    *   Requires multiple scans of the database.
*   **Mining Multilevel Association Rules:**
    *   Finding associations at different levels of abstraction in a concept hierarchy (e.g., "computer" vs. "laptop computer").
    *   **Approaches:**
        *   **Uniform Minimum Support:** Same threshold for all levels (can miss low-level or generate uninteresting high-level rules).
        *   **Reduced Minimum Support:** Different, decreasing thresholds for deeper abstraction levels.
        *   **Group-Based Minimum Support:** User-defined thresholds for specific item groups.
*   **Mining Multidimensional Association Rules:**
    *   Rules involving two or more dimensions or predicates.
    *   **Inter-dimensional:** Distinct predicates (e.g., `age(X) ^ occupation(X) => buys(X)`).
    *   **Hybrid-dimensional:** Repeated predicates (e.g., `age(X) ^ buys(X, laptop) => buys(X, printer)`).
*   **Mining Quantitative Association Rules:**
    *   Multidimensional rules where numeric attributes are dynamically discretized during mining to satisfy criteria like maximizing confidence.
    *   Often involves two quantitative attributes on the LHS and one categorical attribute on the RHS (e.g., `age(X) ^ income(X) => buys(X, HDTV)`).
*   **From Association Mining to Correlation Analysis:**
    *   Augmenting association rules with a correlation measure (e.g., Lift) to indicate statistical correlation beyond just support and confidence.
