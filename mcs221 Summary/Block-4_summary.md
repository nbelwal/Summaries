### Unit 10: Classification

**Main Idea:** Classification is a supervised data mining process that assigns items to predefined target categories or classes to predict their class labels accurately.

**Key Points:**
*   **Definition:** A data mining process that assigns items in a collection to target categories/classes, aiming to predict the target class for each record.
*   **Process:** Two-step:
    1.  **Learning/Training Phase:** A classification model (classifier) is built by analyzing a training set with known class labels (supervised learning).
    2.  **Classification Phase:** The model predicts class labels for new, unseen data, and its accuracy is estimated using a separate test set.
*   **Types:** Binary classification (two outcomes, e.g., spam/not spam) and Multiclass classification (more than two outcomes, e.g., low/medium/high credit risk).
*   **Applications:** Product recommendation, weather prediction, disease classification, financial fraud detection, spam filtering, sentiment analysis, image recognition, and more.
*   **Common Classification Algorithms:**
    *   **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN):**
        *   **Concept:** Lazy, non-parametric, supervised algorithm that classifies a data point based on the majority class of its 'k' nearest neighbors.
        *   **Distance Metrics:** Euclidean (most common), Manhattan, Hamming, Minkowski.
        *   **Pros:** Easy to understand/implement, suitable for non-linear data, handles multi-class cases, performs well with sufficient representative data.
        *   **Cons:** High computation/memory, sensitive to irrelevant features, requires choosing 'k'.
    *   **Decision Tree Classifier:**
        *   **Concept:** Flowchart-like tree structure where internal nodes are tests on attributes, branches are outcomes, and leaf nodes are classes. Classifies by traversing from root to leaf.
        *   **Algorithm (ID3 variant):** Recursively partitions data based on the attribute that provides the highest information gain.
        *   **Attribute Selection Measures:**
            *   **Entropy:** Measures uncertainty/diversification of labels (lower entropy is purer).
            *   **Information Gain:** Measures the reduction in entropy after a split (higher gain = better split).
            *   **Gain Ratio:** Normalizes information gain to counteract bias towards attributes with many values.
            *   **Gini Index:** Measures impurity, used in CART, favors larger distributions and performs binary splits.
        *   **Tree Pruning:** Methods (prepruning, postpruning) to address overfitting by removing unreliable branches, leading to faster and more accurate classification.
        *   **Pros:** Simple to understand/interpret, handles numerical/categorical data, produces comprehensible rules, robust to data violations, performs well with large data.
        *   **Cons:** Less suited for estimating constant attribute values, vulnerable to mistakes with limited training data, computationally costly (training/pruning), susceptible to data fragmentation, high variance/unstable.
    *   **Bayesian Classification (Naïve Bayes):**
        *   **Concept:** Statistical classifier based on Bayes’ Theorem, predicts class membership probabilities. Assumes "class conditional independence" (attributes are independent given the class label) to simplify computations.
        *   **Pros:** Fast, highly scalable, handles binary and multiclass problems, simple, effective for text classification (e.g., spam filtering, sentiment analysis).
        *   **Cons:** Assumes feature independence, which may not always hold in practice.
    *   **Support Vector Machines (SVM):**
        *   **Concept:** Supervised algorithm that finds an optimal hyperplane (decision boundary) to separate data points of different classes. Uses a "kernel trick" to map non-linearly separable data into a higher dimension where a linear separation is possible.
        *   **Support Vectors:** Key training data points that lie closest to the decision boundary and define the maximal margin.
        *   **Pros:** High accuracy, less prone to overfitting (complexity depends on support vectors, not feature dimension), effective for high-dimensional data.
        *   **Cons:** Training can be slow, sensitive to kernel function choice, less effective with noisy data.
    *   **Rule-Based Classification:**
        *   **Concept:** Uses a set of IF-THEN rules (Condition → Class Label) for classification.
        *   **Metrics:** Coverage (fraction of records satisfying antecedent) and Accuracy (fraction of covered records satisfying consequent).
        *   **Rule Sets:** Can be mutually exclusive (at most one rule fires) and exhaustive (at least one rule fires).
        *   **Building Rules:** Direct methods (e.g., Sequential-Covering, RIPPER) extract rules directly from data; Indirect methods (e.g., C4.5 Rules) extract from other models like decision trees.
        *   **Pros:** Highly expressive, easy to interpret, comparable performance to decision trees, handles redundant attributes, better for imbalanced classes.
        *   **Cons:** Can be harder to handle missing values.
*   **Model Evaluation and Selection:**
    *   **Purpose:** To assess model quality, refine parameters, and choose the best model.
    *   **Approaches:**
        *   **Train, Validation, and Test Datasets:** Simplest, but requires large datasets.
        *   **Resampling Methods:** (for smaller datasets)
            *   **Cross-validation:** Splits data multiple times for training and validation.
            *   **Holdout Method:** Single train-test split (high variance).
            *   **k-fold Cross-validation:** Divides data into 'k' subsets, training on k-1 and testing on 1, repeated 'k' times. Reduces variance.
            *   **Stratified K-Fold:** Preserves the proportion of class labels in each fold.
            *   **Bootstrap:** Resampling with replacement, training on bootstrap samples, evaluating on out-of-bag samples.
        *   **Probabilistic Statistics:** Combine model performance and complexity (no hold-out needed).
            *   **Akaike Information Criterion (AIC):** Measures information loss, tends to select more complex models.
            *   **Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC):** Penalizes model complexity, tends to select simpler models for large datasets.
            *   **Minimum Description Length (MDL):** Measures minimum bits to represent the model and its predictions.
    *   **Classification Metrics:**
        *   **Confusion Matrix:** Table summarizing correct (True Positives, True Negatives) and incorrect (False Positives, False Negatives) classifications.
        *   **Accuracy:** Overall correctness, but misleading for imbalanced datasets.
        *   **Precision:** Proportion of correctly predicted positives among all predicted positives (minimizes false alarms).
        *   **Recall:** Proportion of correctly predicted positives among all actual positives (minimizes misses).
        *   **F1-Score:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing both.
        *   **Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve:** Plots True Positive Rate (TPR) vs. False Positive Rate (FPR), visually depicting model performance trade-offs, robust to class skew.
        *   **Log Loss:** Measures the uncertainty of predictions, lower is better.
